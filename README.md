# Pacman-Clone
A first year university project where we had to re-create Pacman using a pre-given Framework
## About The Project
We were tasked to create a Pacman like game in C++ using an framework known as S2D. As most of us were all new to C++, figuring out how to create the game was quite the task. I tried to create something as close to the orignal PacMan but had to cut out a lot of stuff such as proper enemy AI due to time loss and still being new to the idea of game development outside engines

## Built With
[S2D](https://bitbucket.org/staffscgp/s2d/src/master/) - The Framwork
